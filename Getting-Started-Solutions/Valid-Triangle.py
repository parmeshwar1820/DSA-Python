Problem
Write a program to check whether a triangle is valid or not, when the three angles of the triangle are the inputs. A triangle is valid if the sum of all the three angles is equal to 180 degrees.

Input
The first line contains an integer T, the total number of testcases. Then T lines follow, each line contains three angles A, B and C, of the triangle separated by space.

Output
For each test case, display 'YES' if the triangle is valid, and 'NO', if it is not, in a new line.

t=int(input())
while t>0:
    a,b,c=map(int, input().split())
    if a+b+c==180:
        print("YES")
    else:
        print("NO")
    t=t-1
